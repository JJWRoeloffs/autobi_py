/**
 * QCMFeatureExtractor extracts QuantizedContourModel log likelihood features.
 * <p/>
 * This feature extractor is currently deprecated by not following the AuToBI v1.4 feature naming
 * conventions. <p/> NOTE: The challenge here is that the QCM model itself is a retrieved resource
 * that isn't 'created' at runtime by the by the feature extraction routine.  This suggests a
 * resource registry that can be indexed by a string to attach a trained model.  Here resources
 * would be registered via a config file or default paths pointing to a resource path (within the
 * jar)  This is a strong candidate for inclusion in 1.4.1.
